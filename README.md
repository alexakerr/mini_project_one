Hello ! 

Below I have outline steps for using this To-Do List App:

Adding Tasks: You can add a new task to the list by selecting option 1 from the menu and then entering any task you would like to add.

Viewing Tasks: When you choose option 2, it allows you to view all the tasks thats are currently in your To-Do List, and if there are no tasks it will notify you that there are none.

Delete a Task: You can remove a task from the list by selecting option 3, then you could enter the number corresponding to the task you want to delete.

Quit: Option 4 exits the app and thanks you for using the To-Do List App.
